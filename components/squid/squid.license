 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 *         Duane Wessels of the University of Colorado at Boulder.
 *  
 *   This copyright notice applies to software in the Harvest
 *   ``src/'' directory only.  Users should consult the individual
 *   copyright notices in the ``components/'' subdirectories for
 *   copyright information about other software bundled with the
 *   Harvest source code distribution.
 *  
 * TERMS OF USE
 *   
 *   The Harvest software may be used and re-distributed without
 *   charge, provided that the software origin and research team are

 *  
 * DERIVATIVE WORKS
 *  
 *   Users may make derivative works from the Harvest software, subject 
 *   to the following constraints:
 *  
 *     - You must include the above copyright notice and these 
 *       accompanying paragraphs in all forms of derivative works, 
 *       and any documentation and other materials related to such

 *  
 *     - You must clearly notify users that your are distributing 
 *       a modified version and not the original Harvest software.
 *  
 *     - Any derivative product is also subject to these copyright 
 *       and use restrictions.
 *  
 *   Note that the Harvest software is NOT in the public domain.  We

 *  
 * HISTORY OF FREE SOFTWARE STATUS
 *  
 *   Originally we required sites to license the software in cases
 *   where they were going to build commercial products/services
 *   around Harvest.  In June 1995 we changed this policy.  We now
 *   allow people to use the core Harvest software (the code found in
 *   the Harvest ``src/'' directory) for free.  We made this change
 *   in the interest of encouraging the widest possible deployment of
 *   the technology.  The Harvest software is really a reference
 *   implementation of a set of protocols and formats, some of which
 *   we intend to standardize.  We encourage commercial
 *   re-implementations of code complying to this set of standards.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
      encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
      with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and
      independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A
      work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
      Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.

   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
      other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
      dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
      art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
      Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
      constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
      the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
      a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work
      in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
      Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.

   c. "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
      terms of this License.

   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.

   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
      of this License.

   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
      who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
      the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
      exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
Work as stated below:

   a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
      Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;

   b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;

   c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
      the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;

   d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
      Derivative Works.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

       i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
          exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
          rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
          performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.

      ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
          exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
          agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
          phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
          subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
          US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
      where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right
      to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
      SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g.
      webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
      Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
      must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
      License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
      not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms
      of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
      hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
      notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
      You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
      access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
      the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
      create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required
      by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
      from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.

   b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works,
      You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
      reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
      Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if
      the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
      (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in
      Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
      means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
      supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
      Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
      Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
      identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French
      translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
      original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any
      reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative
      Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
      other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as
      prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.  SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or
      entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You
      under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
      provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
      under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
      time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
      this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
      granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
      Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
      this License.

   b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the
      same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
      License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
      extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
      by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
      or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
      shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
      communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
      mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED
TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN
CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
      pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
      arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
      or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or
      any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
      including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that
      a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation
      for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
      Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of
      the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
      considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
      encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
      or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
      below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their
      contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included
      in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
      themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
      defined below) for the purposes of this License.

   c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
      https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
      Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,
      including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that
      have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this
      License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of
      works made available under that license under this License or a Creative
      Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
      License.

   d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies

      (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal
      entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
      (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
      broadcast.

   h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
      this License including without limitation any production in the literary,

      expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
      writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
      in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a
      cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process

      it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety
      or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a
      literary or artistic work.

   i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
      who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
      the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to

   j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
      communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
      process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital

      members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place

   k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including

      and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
      including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
      label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the
      original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original
      work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
      in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

        i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
           which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
           compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
           the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
           of the rights granted under this License;

       ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
           the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive
           right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
           granted under this License; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
           royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is
           a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
           schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
           granted under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
      this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
      Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
      recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
      under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
      keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer
      of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not
      impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
      ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted
      to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
      require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
      the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from
      any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You
      create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
      Section 4(c), as requested.

   b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms
      of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
      License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction
      license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
      License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US));
      (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation
      under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the
      terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of
      any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
      License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
      generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or
      the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms
      on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
      ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted
      to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You
      must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
      the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in
      the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any
      effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the
      ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
      granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This
      Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection,
      but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself
      to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

   c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
      Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
      4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
      reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
      Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
      Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
      or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the
      title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable,
      the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
      unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
      information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the
      case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
      Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
      "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
      required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
      provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
      minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors
      of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
      in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
      contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
      credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
      manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License,
      You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
      sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
      Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
      without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
      otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
      Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
      or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
      derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
      the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
      jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
      deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
      action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
      Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
      fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
      reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right
      to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from
      You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
      provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
      licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of
      this License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
      perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
      Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
      under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
      time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
      this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be,
      granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms
      and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
      offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
      and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
      remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
      parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
      extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
      by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
      respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements
      or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor
      shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
      communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
      mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
      License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for
      the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,
      1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the
      WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal
      Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and
      subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the
      License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the
      applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
      applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
      License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License;
      this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
      applicable law.
