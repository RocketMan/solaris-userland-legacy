BIND version 9.18.9

Solaris  11.4  now  provides  BIND  9.18  Stable  Version  which  uses
OpenSSL 3.

ISC, the authors  of BIND, declared the 9.11 branch  to be end-of-life
as  of March  2022 and  superseded it  by BIND  9.16 Extended  Support
Version (ESV) and BIND 9.18 Current-Stable for OpenSSL 3 support.

As of  Solaris 11.4.51,  BIND was  updated to 9.16  ESV as  an interim
measure.   It has  subsequently been  updated to  BIND 9.18  utilising
OpenSSL 3.

BIND versions  are for  the most part  compatible.  Some  features may
however be deprecated.  Most configurable  features that are no longer
applicable are ignored.  The update  from 9.11 branch was significant,
and while most configurations will be fine there are some known issues
(see below).   It may therefore  be necessary to  modify named.conf(5)
following this update.  For more  detailed information please refer to
the BIND documentation:

- https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/v9_18_9/notes.html#notes-for-bind-9-18-9


Known Issues
------------

Upgrading from BIND 9.16.32, 9.18.6,  or any older version may require
a  manual  configuration  change.  The  following  configurations  are
affected:

- `type  primary` zones  configured with  `dnssec-policy` but  without
  either `allow-update` or `update-policy`,
- `type secondary` zones configured with `dnssec-policy`.

In these cases please add `inline-signing yes`; to the individual zone
configuration(s).  Without  applying this  change, named will  fail to
start.  For more details, see:

- https://kb.isc.org/docs/dnssec-policy-requires-dynamic-dns-or-inline-signing


Important note regarding chroot environments
--------------------------------------------

   Any  update  to  BIND  requires   a  re-evaluation  to  the  chroot
   environment as  BIND's libraries and its  fourth party dependencies
   are subject  to change.  With  BIND 9.16 the network  interface was
   completely refactored  to use  libuv and so  this is  an additional
   dependency  that will  need  to  be catered  for.   With BIND  9.18
   OpenSSL 3 libraries are needed too.

   Oracle  recommends using  Solaris  Zones which  provide a  security
   boundary with  a Common Criteria evaluation  for containment. Zones
   are automatically updated by pkg(1)  ensuring they have the correct
   dependencies and fixes therein.


Verification of BIND configuration
----------------------------------

Following  package update,  and  before rebooting  into  the new  Boot
Environment (BE)  it is recommended  that you shutdown BIND  using the
rndc(8) command as below to quiesce and flush any dynamic zone journal
files.

      # rndc stop -p

Proceed once the named(8) process id, as displayed by rndc output, has
stopped running.  If rndc is not configured then continue to reboot as
normal. Note that BIND 9.16 and 9.18 can read BIND 9.11 journal files,
but  beware that  BIND 9.11  can not  read BIND  9.16 or  9.18 journal
files.

Once booted  into the updated BE  check the SMF service  dns/server is
enabled   and   online.    Then    check   the   configuration   using
named-checkconf(8) command  and modify the  configuration accordingly,
do  this if  the  service is  offline  or online  as  it may  indicate
statements that are deprecated.

      # named-checkconf -z

Significant work included in the 9.16 and 9.18 branch
-----------------------------------------------------

    1.  The  new  Key  and  Signing  Policy  (KASP)  feature  provides
       simplified  DNSSEC key  and signing  management using  policies
       defined by the "dnssec-policy" statement. This tool is intended
       to   significantly   facilitate   ongoing   key   and   signing
       maintenance.

    2.  The  way  that  DNSSEC  trust anchors  are  managed  has  been
       improved. Please note the updated CLI for this.

    3. DLV (Domain Look-aside  Verification) has been deprecated since
       BIND  9.12.  dlv.isc.org  (the   main  service  used  by  those
       previously  relying on  DLV, operated  by ISC)  was turned  off
       in  2017. Support  for DLV  has now  been removed  from BIND  9
       completely. Removing this feature required a multi-year process
       of notification, working with partners, and gradual deprecation
       to avoid disruption in the DNS.

Removal of pkcs11 commands:

    The  following  commands and  associated  manual  pages have  been
    removed with immediate effect.

        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-destroy
        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-keygen
        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-list
        /usr/sbin/pkcs11-tokens
