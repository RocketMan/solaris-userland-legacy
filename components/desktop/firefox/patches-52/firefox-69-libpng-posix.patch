-/* Feature Test Macros.  The following are defined here to ensure that correctly
- * implemented libraries reveal the APIs libpng needs to build and hide those
- * that are not needed and potentially damaging to the compilation.
- *
- * Feature Test Macros must be defined before any system header is included (see
- * POSIX 1003.1 2.8.2 "POSIX Symbols."
- *
- * These macros only have an effect if the operating system supports either
- * POSIX 1003.1 or C99, or both.  On other operating systems (particularly
- * Windows/Visual Studio) there is no effect; the OS specific tests below are
- * still required (as of 2011-05-02.)
