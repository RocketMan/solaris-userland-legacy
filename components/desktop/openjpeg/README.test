Without test data, only 9% of regression tests pass (this is the default).
To use upstream test data do
wget https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg-data/archive/master.zip
unzip -q master.zip
UPSTREAMTESTS=openjpeg-data-master gmake test

Note: Some upstream tests are known to fail. See
https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/blob/master/tools/travis-ci/knownfailures-all.txt
