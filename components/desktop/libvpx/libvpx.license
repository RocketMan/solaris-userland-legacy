"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM
codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.

Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where
such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

libvpx-1.8.0/md5_utils.c:

 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.

 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions
  - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
 Still in the public domain.

  Test the buffer model here before subtracting the frame. Do so because
     * the way the leaky bucket model works in libvpx is to allow the buffer to
     * empty - and then stop showing frames until we've got enough bits to
     * show one. As noted in comment below (issue 495), this does not currently
     * apply to key frames. For now exclude key frames in condition below.

 Google Test.  They are subject to change without notice.

 FilePath - a class for file and directory pathname manipulation which
 handles platform-specific conventions (like the pathname separator).
 Used for helper functions for naming files in a directory for xml output.
 Except for Set methods, all methods are const or static, which provides an
 "immutable value object" -- useful for peace of mind.
 A FilePath with a value ending in a path separator ("like/this/") represents
 a directory, otherwise it is assumed to represent a file. In either case,
 it may or may not represent an actual file or directory in the file system.
 Names are NOT checked for syntax correctness -- no checking for illegal
 characters, malformed paths, etc.

 A "smart" pointer type with reference tracking.  Every pointer to a
 particular object is kept on a circular linked list.  When the last pointer
 to an object is destroyed or reassigned, the object is deleted.

 Used properly, this deletes the object when the last reference goes away.
 There are several caveats:
 - Like all reference counting schemes, cycles lead to leaks.
 - Each smart pointer is actually two pointers (8 bytes instead of 4).
 - Every time a pointer is assigned, the entire list of pointers to that
   object is traversed.  This class is therefore NOT SUITABLE when there
   will often be more than two or three pointers to a particular object.
 - References are only tracked as long as linked_ptr<> objects are copied.
   If a linked_ptr<> is converted to a raw pointer and back, BAD THINGS
   will happen (double deletion).

 A good use of this class is storing object references in STL containers.
 You can safely put linked_ptr<> in a vector<>.
 Other uses may not be as good.

 Note: If you use an incomplete type with linked_ptr<>, the class
 *containing* linked_ptr<> must have a constructor and destructor (even
 if they do nothing!).

 Bill Gibbons suggested we use something like this.

 Thread Safety:
   Unlike other linked_ptr implementations, in this implementation
   a linked_ptr object is thread-safe in the sense that:
     - it's safe to copy linked_ptr objects concurrently,
     - it's safe to copy *from* a linked_ptr and read its underlying
       raw pointer (e.g. via get()) concurrently, and
     - it's safe to write to two linked_ptrs that point to the same
       shared object concurrently.
 FIXME: rename this to safe_linked_ptr to avoid
 confusion with normal linked_ptr.

 Protects copying of all linked_ptr objects.

 memset for temp is meant to clear the source buffer (not dest) so that
 SIMD that reads full multiple of 16 bytes will not trigger msan errors.
 memset is not needed for production, as the garbage values are processed but
 not used, although there may be edge cases for subsampling.
 The size of the buffer is based on the largest read, which can be inferred
 by the source type (e.g. ARGB) and the mask (last parameter), or by examining
 the source code for how much the source pointers are advanced.

 Subsampled source needs to be increase by 1 of not even.

libvpx-1.8.0/md5_utils.c:

 This code implements the MD5 message-digest algorithm.
 The algorithm is due to Ron Rivest.  This code was
 written by Colin Plumb in 1993, no copyright is claimed.
 This code is in the public domain; do with it what you wish.

 Equivalent code is available from RSA Data Security, Inc.
 This code has been tested against that, and is equivalent,
 except that you don't need to include two pages of legalese
 with every copy.

 To compute the message digest of a chunk of bytes, declare an
 MD5Context structure, pass it to MD5Init, call MD5Update as
 needed on buffers full of bytes, and then call MD5Final, which
 will fill a supplied 16-byte array with the digest.

 Changed so as no longer to depend on Colin Plumb's `usual.h' header
 definitions
  - Ian Jackson <ian@chiark.greenend.org.uk>.
 Still in the public domain.

  Test the buffer model here before subtracting the frame. Do so because
     * the way the leaky bucket model works in libvpx is to allow the buffer to
     * empty - and then stop showing frames until we've got enough bits to
     * show one. As noted in comment below (issue 495), this does not currently
     * apply to key frames. For now exclude key frames in condition below.

 Google Test filepath utilities

 This header file declares classes and functions used internally by
 Google Test.  They are subject to change without notice.

 GOOGLETEST_CM0001 DO NOT DELETE
 FilePath - a class for file and directory pathname manipulation which
 handles platform-specific conventions (like the pathname separator).
 Used for helper functions for naming files in a directory for xml output.
 Except for Set methods, all methods are const or static, which provides an
 "immutable value object" -- useful for peace of mind.
 A FilePath with a value ending in a path separator ("like/this/") represents
 a directory, otherwise it is assumed to represent a file. In either case,
 it may or may not represent an actual file or directory in the file system.
 Names are NOT checked for syntax correctness -- no checking for illegal
 characters, malformed paths, etc.

 A "smart" pointer type with reference tracking.  Every pointer to a
 particular object is kept on a circular linked list.  When the last pointer
 to an object is destroyed or reassigned, the object is deleted.

 Used properly, this deletes the object when the last reference goes away.
 There are several caveats:
 - Like all reference counting schemes, cycles lead to leaks.
 - Each smart pointer is actually two pointers (8 bytes instead of 4).
 - Every time a pointer is assigned, the entire list of pointers to that
   object is traversed.  This class is therefore NOT SUITABLE when there
   will often be more than two or three pointers to a particular object.
 - References are only tracked as long as linked_ptr<> objects are copied.
   If a linked_ptr<> is converted to a raw pointer and back, BAD THINGS
   will happen (double deletion).

 A good use of this class is storing object references in STL containers.
 You can safely put linked_ptr<> in a vector<>.
 Other uses may not be as good.

 Note: If you use an incomplete type with linked_ptr<>, the class
 *containing* linked_ptr<> must have a constructor and destructor (even
 if they do nothing!).

 Bill Gibbons suggested we use something like this.

 Thread Safety:
   Unlike other linked_ptr implementations, in this implementation
   a linked_ptr object is thread-safe in the sense that:
     - it's safe to copy linked_ptr objects concurrently,
     - it's safe to copy *from* a linked_ptr and read its underlying
       raw pointer (e.g. via get()) concurrently, and
     - it's safe to write to two linked_ptrs that point to the same
       shared object concurrently.
 FIXME: rename this to safe_linked_ptr to avoid
 confusion with normal linked_ptr.

 GOOGLETEST_CM0001 DO NOT DELETE
 Protects copying of all linked_ptr objects.

 memset for temp is meant to clear the source buffer (not dest) so that
 SIMD that reads full multiple of 16 bytes will not trigger msan errors.
 memset is not needed for production, as the garbage values are processed but
 not used, although there may be edge cases for subsampling.
 The size of the buffer is based on the largest read, which can be inferred
 by the source type (e.g. ARGB) and the mask (last parameter), or by examining
 the source code for how much the source pointers are advanced.

 Subsampled source needs to be increase by 1 of not even.
