Note: Google Go 1.7 is obsolete and will be removed in the future. Migrate to
gccgo (GNU Go Compiler) instead provided by pkg://solaris/developer/gcc/gcc-go
package. Existing Go applications have to be rebuilt using gccgo's "go build"
tool and Go packages that are not bundled in gccgo distribution such as
"lint", "sys", "tour" and "tools" need to be obtained from upstream repository
e.g. using "go get" tool.
