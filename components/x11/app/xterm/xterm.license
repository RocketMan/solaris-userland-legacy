 * Compact and efficient reimplementation of the
 * xterm character class mechanism for large character sets
 *
 * Markus Kuhn -- mkuhn@acm.org -- 2000-07-03
 *
 * xterm allows users to select entire words with a double-click on the left
 * mouse button.  Opinions might differ on what type of characters are part of
 * separate words, therefore xterm allows users to configure a class code for
 * each 8-bit character.  Words are maximum length sequences of neighboring
 * characters with identical class code.  Extending this mechanism to Unicode
 * naively would create an at least 2^16 entries (128 kB) long class code
 * table.
 *
 * Instead, we transform the character class table into a list of intervals,
 * that will be accessed via a linear search.  Changes made to the table by the
 * user will be appended.  A special class code IDENT (default) marks
 * characters who have their code number as the class code.
 *
 * We could alternatively use a sorted table of non-overlapping intervals that
 * can be accessed via binary search, but merging in new intervals is
 * significantly more hassle and not worth the effort here.
