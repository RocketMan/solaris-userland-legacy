Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)

The DRI subsystem, the i915 kernel driver for Intel graphics, and associated
modules for the Xorg server and Mesa library might not be available in a
future update of Oracle Solaris 11.4.

Users of Intel graphics from the 910 chipset up through, and including, the
Intel Core 4th Generation ("Haswell") CPU will need to use the Xorg VESA
driver and Mesa swrast driver instead. If their system has not had manual
configuration applied, this change will happen automatically. If an Xorg
configuration file exists, then it may need to be edited it to remove the
usage of the intel or modesetting drivers for Xorg, as both rely on the
i915 kernel drivers.

Users of other graphics devices will not be affected.
