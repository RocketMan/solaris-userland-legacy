The base VNC protocol is unencrypted, but TigerVNC provides the VeNCrypt
extension to use VNC over TLS to resolve that using the GNUtls library.
This allows TLS encrypted communication between the server and the client.

Also, the base VNC implementation uses vncpasswd which allows users to set the 
password to access VNC desktops.  The default behavior is to prompt for a
VNC password then store an obfuscated version of this password to passwd-file.
Please note that the stored password is not encrypted securely.

Users are recommended to use the more secure method of using PAM 
authentication provided by TigerVNC.

For Solaris, on the ILOMs, we have documented certain required guidelines 
to ensure security during Xvnc usage.  Details can be found at:
