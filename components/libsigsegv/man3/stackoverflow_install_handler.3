.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
In some applications, the \fBstack\fR \fBoverflow\fR \fBhandler\fR performs some cleanup or notifies the user and then immediately terminates the application.  In other applications, the \fBstack\fR \fBoverflow\fR \fBhandler\fR longjmps back to a central point in the application.  This library supports both uses.  In the second case, the handler must ensure to restore the normal signal mask (because many signals are blocked while the handler is executed), and must also call \fBsigsegv_leave_handler()\fR to transfer control; then only it can longjmp away.
.sp
.LP
The handler is run at a moment when nothing about the global state of the program is known. Therefore it cannot use facilities that manipulate global variables or locks. In particular, it cannot use malloc(); use mmap() Instead. It cannot use fopen(); use open() instead. Etc. All global variables that are accessed by the handler should be mark
'volatile'.

typedef void (*\fBstackoverflow_handler_t\fR) (\fIint emergency\fR, 
.RS +28
\fIstackoverflow_context_t scp\fR);
.RE
.sp
\fIStackoverflow_handler_t\fR is the type of a stack overflow handler. Such a handler should perform a longjmp call in order to reduce the amount of stack needed. It must not return.The \fIemergency\fR argument is 0 when the stack could be repared, or 1 if the application should better save its state and exit now.
.sp
.LP
The \fIextra_stack\fR argument is a pointer to a preallocated area used as a stack for executing the handler. It is typically allocated by use of `alloca' during `main'. Its size should be sufficiently large.
.sp
.LP
The \fIextra_stack_size\fR is the size of the extra_stack argument.
.sp
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
If success, \fBstackoverflow_install_handler()\fR returns 0 on success, or -1 if the system doesn't support catching stack overflow.
