The TCL extension doesn't have a version corresponding with the SQLite itself,
which AFAICT is not something that happened before.

I asked upstream about this and got no answer yet, but this change shouldn't
break anything and it will keep tea/libsqliteXXX.so in line with SQLite itself.

This issue was reported upstream:
