Subject: [PATCH] manager: Fix possible crash by initializing display

Some people insist on running sessions in ways where we cannot detect
them properly. In that case, we shouldn't find a display, but the
variable was not initialized and we could end up accessing random memory
resulting in a crash.

Fix it by adding the missing initializer.

Closes: #555
