Patch migrated from Desktop, where it was listed as:
#owner:yippi date:2005-08-14 type:feature

Patch default-path to not include "." because on Solaris we want to avoid
setting PATH to include the current working directory.  This was an
ARC requirement.  The GNOME community already decided to not change
this behavior (bugzilla bug 317945), but this change is safe.  This
code only gets executed when the user's PATH is unset, which should
be never.  Safer to avoid adding "." to PATH.
