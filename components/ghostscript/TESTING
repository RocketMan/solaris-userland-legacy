1. Check version

  $ build/amd64/bin/gs -h # update the path for sparc
  GPL Ghostscript 9.27 (2019-04-04)

2. Test functionality

  Use 'test' target to verify basic ghostscript functionality. It consists of two
  tests:

  a) The output of devices generating deterministic data is compared against
  stored version.
  b) Devices known to generate non empty output are tested to do so.

  $ gmake test                                                    
  ...
  No differences found.

  Tests could fail for various reasons. For a) case the most probable reason is
  either rendering engine/font change or unused data change. For b) it is
  probably device removal. Check and update appropriately.

  'system-test' target runs the same set of tests while using system gs.

3. Test dependency on other components

  Ghostscipt is a build time dependecy for libspectre and graphviz. Any uprev or
  interface change in ghostscript should be tested by creating a build machine
  with new bits installed; then building each component.
