1) Unit tests should pass on both platforms.

	$ gmake test

  libtests/qtest/rc4.test tests are expected to fail. They require

	pkg:/library/security/openssl-3/legacy-provider

   to be installed, but the package is not installed by default. For component
   upgrade, please test them manually.

2.1) Pick a virtual and create a VM based on ST_userland_build.

	$ vm create ST_userland_build qpdf

2.2) Install the package.

	$ pkg install pkg:/library/security/openssl-3/legacy-provider

2.3) Edit the config and enable the provider.

	$ sudo vim /etc/openssl/3/conf.d/legacymodule.cnf

     Uncomment the last line.

	activate = 1

2.4) Setup the workspace as instructed and transfer the change you have made
     there.
2.5) Build.
2.6) Run test-complete there. The target will run unit tests expecting all
     tests to pass.

	$ gmake test-complete
