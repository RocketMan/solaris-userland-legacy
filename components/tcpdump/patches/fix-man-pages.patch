In Solaris 11.4, we will be normalizing man pages. See PSARC 2015/428.
This means that what was section 4, is now section 5 and what was in
section 5 is now in section 7. But currently only for Solaris 11.4.

This patch should eventually be sent upstream, but for that to happen
it will need to be reworked into a form that will be acceptable for
all versions of Solaris. Until then, we are just using this Solaris 11.4
specific patch.
