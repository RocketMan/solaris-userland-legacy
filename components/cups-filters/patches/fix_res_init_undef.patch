To avoid linking of unnecessary libraries (crypto, zlib),
'cups-config --libs' started to report only '-lcups' instead of
'-lcups -lgssapi_krb5 -lkrb5 -lk5crypto -lcom_err -lz -lpthread -lresolv -lm -lz'.
For that reason, the linkage phase fails during the creation of
cups-browsed executable as 'res_init' symbol from libresolv library
is undefined. The patch adds '-lresolv' flag to Solaris linker.

cups-config: only CUPS libraries go in non-static `cups-config --libs`
https://github.com/apple/cups/pull/5261

The patch might be suitable for upstream, however,
I do not know why this was not spotted on Linux.
