# Two tests are known to fail. These failures are not critical.
#
# One fails because it says the library does not throw a value error on a
# bad URL. This one fails, as the bad url it is trying is an edge case:
# ldap:///?????  and not that important.  The OpenLDAP library doesn't 
# have the necessary code to check for that case and error out.  We (or
# someone from the python-ldap team) would have to log an OpenLDAP bug,
# propose a fix to the code, see it integrated, wait for a release, and
# integrate the new release into Userland.
#
# The other failure is for a test case that has a comment before the test case:
# # these two constants are pointless? XXX
# The answer being yes.  And the constants are not defined in the latest
# version of python-ldap.
