We are not using certifi package on Solaris as the location of the standard
certs bundle is patched directly into requests.

charset_normalizer was brought in to remove license ambiguity for projects
bundling requests (LGPL chardet used by Apache licensed requests). We already
provide chardet, and our legal has no issue with it, so there is no reason to
use it for now.
