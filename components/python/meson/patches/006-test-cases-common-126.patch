This patch is necessary because Userland passes -z text in LD_OPTIONS_SO,
which is good for most shared objects, but triggers an error in this test.
It isn't necessary upstream when not built in such environments.

Subject: [PATCH] Fix "test cases/common/126 object only target" on Solaris

If object is not built pic, trying to link it into libshr.so fails:

[6/8] Linking target libshr.so.
FAILED: libshr.so
gcc  -o libshr.so 'shr@sha/source2.o' -Wl,--no-undefined -Wl,--as-needed -shared -fPIC -Wl,--start-group -Wl,-soname,libshr.so -Wl,--end-group
Text relocation remains                         referenced

.text (section)                     0x20        shr@sha/source2.o
ld: fatal: relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections
