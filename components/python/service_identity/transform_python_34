# service_identity-34 was never released as a non-legacy package which breaks
# some legacy automation assumptions.

# 1. the service_identity-34 should not depend on the non-legacy version. Sadly
# we don't seem to be able to match against %{pkg.fmri}, but instead we can
# detect that the legacy automation creates this dependency as 'optional'
<transform depend type=optional fmri=.*/service_identity-34 -> drop>

# 2. the meta package should not depend on the non-legacy version, it should
# depend on the legacy one instead. This depend is of type 'conditional' so the
# previous transform did not match.
<transform depend fmri=.*/service_identity-34 -> edit fmri library/python legacy/library/python>
